# Replication of Spielman et al's 2020 Evaluation of Social Vulnerability Indicators

### Description

This study is a *replication* of:

> Spielman, S. E., Tuccillo, J., Folch, D. C., Schweikert, A., Davies, R., Wood, N., & Tate, E. (2020). Evaluating Social Vulnerability Indicators: Criteria and their Application to the Social Vulnerability Index. Natural Hazards, 100(1), 417â€“436. https://doi.org/10.1007/s11069-019-03820-z

The original paper develops methods to evaluate the validity of social vulnerability indicators and applies them to SoVI, revealing issues with internal consistency and construct validity.
Their paper implements these methods by calculating SoVI over various spatial extents in the USA.
We first reproduce their results and then extend their work with a replication study, determining how robust SoVI is to changes over time.

### Compendium structure and contents

This research compendium is structured with four main directories:

- `data`: contains subdirectories for `raw` data and `derived` data.
- `docs`: contains subdirectories for `manuscript`, `presentation`, and `report`
- `procedure`: contains subdirectories for `code` or software scripts, information about the computational `environment` in which the research was conducted, and non-code research `protocols`
- `results`: contains subdirectories for `figures`, formatted data `tables`, or `other` formats of research results.

The data, procedures, and results of this repository are outlined in three tables:
- Data: [data/data_metadata.csv](data/data_metadata.csv)
